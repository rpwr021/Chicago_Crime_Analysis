Police said a gun was recovered.The victim was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition with six gunshot wounds to the groin area, officials said. The man has a history of misdemeanor arrests and is currently on probation after pleading guilty last year to aggravated fleeing, but he did not have a court date Monday, said his attorney, Jayne Ingles.“I don’t know why he was there,” she said.Crime scene tape marked off an area of California Avenue in front of a Popeye’s chicken restaurant across 26th Street from the courthouse. Witnesses said police and an ambulance quickly converged on the area after the shooting.The spray of gunfire startled attorneys arriving for morning hearings. Goldberg said he was running a little late when pulled into a small privately owned lot next to the Popeye’s and found police swarming the area. Investigators found a shell casing near the spot where Goldberg would have parked his black Rolls-Royce Phantom.Goldberg said the shooting has made him “reassess” his safety when visiting the courthouse.A food truck vendor who has worked outside the courthouse for some 30 years said Monday that he was making tacos for a customer and thought he heard a bus backfire on California Avenue.“Then somebody said, ‘Oh somebody’s shooting,’” said the vendor, who declined to give his name.It’s the second shooting this month involving a victim coming or going from the massive courthouse and jail complex.

His condition was stabilized at Holy Cross Hospital.\\xa0A nearby resident, holding a plate of food, watched from across the street as officers taped off the van that had stopped near the intersection of Carpenter and 54th streets. The 51-year-old man said he was surprised he didn\\'t hear any gunshots early Tuesday. He quickly recounted a handful of past neighborhood shootings that have taken place in recent years. \"It\\'s wild over here,\" he said. \"It\\'s these young boys with guns now.

(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune)Three ambulances arrived in minutes but left almost as quickly because the first three people they found were all pronounced dead at the scene.Officers ran toward a commotion farther south and found the fourth victim behind an apartment building on Coles, slumped against a tree. It was the woman’s other son.Soon afterward, a man tried to walk along a barbed-wire fence that he had climbed to get behind the building, telling police the victim was his brother.An exasperated look came over an officer\\'s face as he looked to the ground while two other\\xa0officers started pushing people back.One child still carrying his backpack, the hood of his winter coat pulled over his head, looked at the body and turned away. A woman put her hand on his back and guided him back toward 75th.The four were fatally shot about 3:50 p.m. A gunman approached the restaurant and fired. It was not immediately clear how many of the four victims were in the restaurant.Dillon Jackson, 20, was found dead outside the restaurant.

She only said one at first, but when I got here they said they found the other.\"I just want them to pick him up ... when they get him off the ground I\\'ll go with him,\" Jackson said. \"I didn\\'t have kids to lose \\'em like this.\"The crowd after the shooting\\xa0dwindled as the night wore on. So too the number of police bosses who had for a time gathered at 75th and Coles.Evidence technicians, detectives and beat cops remained behind, guarding a scene that extended half a block out in each direction from the restaurant. But the Jackson brothers’ mother remained. She blamed herself. She questioned her faith. She said she had nothing to live for, and that she planned to take her own life. \"I can\\'t go on, my life is over. I\\'m about to goddamn kill myself.\\xa0 I was standing right here in the window, they killed \\'em right in front of me.\"Her family consoled her. They hugged her. When she ducked under the tape to try and see her sons, the officers guided her gently away from lines of sight but kept her inside the crime scene. She paced through ankle-deep water in a nursing home parking lot to get to a black iron fence, peering into the yard where Raheem\\'s body lay slumped against a tree. A relative nudged her away. She settled in a space in the parking lot, inside the tape but near the officers, a space she called a \"mutual zone\" where she was about the same distance from each of her dead sons.\"I gotta stand with \\'em both. I can’t leave. I gotta stay with both my sons \\'til they get \\'em up,\" she said.As evidence technicians worked in the yard behind the apartment building and took photos of Raheem\\'s body, his mother drifted toward the black iron fence.

She left him the note anyway, to let him know she’d gone to the police station because she hadn\\'t heard from him. She said she\\'d be back soon, but she was already sure he was dead. Deep down, she knew it as soon as he didn’t return her text.“He didn’t respond, and he always responds,” Campbell said Tuesday. “I didn’t hear no more from him. That was ... I didn’t know his last goodbye was his last goodbye. I always text him, ‘Are you safe?’ And I don’t know why, that day I text him: ‘Are you alive?’ It was like I knew already.”Hours after she filed a missing persons report, Campbell learned that her only child, Ryan Hamilton, 20, and two of his friends were found shot to death in the Monte Carlo that Campbell had given her son. \\xa0The bodies of Hamilton, Vogels Anderson Jr., 19, and Devontae Watson, 18 were discovered around 8 a.m. Monday after someone complained that the Monte Carlo was illegally parked in an alley in the 8600 block of South Throop Street in Gresham. \\xa0Two were found inside the car, the third in the trunk.\\xa0 Hamilton was shot once in the neck, Anderson was shot once in the head and Watson suffered several gunshot wounds.\\xa0 Police have released few other details, including a possible motive.Like Campbell, Anderson\\'s mother had also worried when she did not get a text back from her son.\\n\\nThree people were found dead in a vehicle on the South Side, in the 8600 block of South Throop Street, on March 13, 2017.When Anderson didn\\'t come home Sunday night, Sarah Wicks figured he was with his girlfriend, who attended the University of Illinois in Urbana–Champaign and visited him on weekends.\\xa0 Still, she thought it was unusual when he didn\\'t respond to a text that night. \\xa0Then on Monday morning, Wicks saw a news story on Facebook under the headline, “Three bodies found,” and her mind raced. “Three kids missing and we can\\'t reach nobody,” she said.“What’s hurting me the most, I really want to know who and why,” Wicks said. “Why would y’all want to do this to them boys? They were good boys.”Anderson and Hamilton had been best friends since freshman year at Ralph Ellison High School, where Watson also attended. Wicks described the friends as \"goofy kids,\" her son always cracking jokes and smiling. He even won a tooth brush for best smile in the 8th grade.He had a voice that carried, and his family and friends called him \"Stormy.\"\\xa0 He and his brothers were fortunate kids who “didn’t go without,” said Wicks, who added that she often\\xa0traveled with her sons to new cities “so they know they have options.” Homicide\\xa0victim Ryan Hamilton, with mother Tami Campbell.

Hamilton, 20, was among three young men found shot to death in a Monte Carlo in the 8600 block of South Throop Street in Gresham early on\\xa0March 13, 2017.Anderson was studying civil engineering in college, according to his father, Vogels Anderson Sr. He was a planner, a “take-charge type of guy,” his father said.“They had plans,” Anderson\\xa0 said. “It’s just baffling that we found them in the neighborhood over there.”Hamilton had just found out Friday that he got a job at Home Depot. His first day was supposed to have been Monday, the day his body was discovered.It was more than a day before Campbell would make it to the Cook County medical examiner\\'s office to identify her boy. She couldn’t will herself to go to the morgue Monday. “I’m afraid to see him today because I don’t want to see a monster, I want to see my beautiful baby boy,\" she said. \"He was not into trafficking drugs, and guns and gang stuff like that. He was just trying to find his way in this world.\"When she did make it to the morgue Tuesday, she had to identify the boy who just a month ago was grinning ear to ear on a cruise ship that ferried mother and son around Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Virgin Islands and the Bahamas. \"I saw my baby ... he will never be coming home,” she wrote in a text to the Tribune. “He has what looks like a cigarette burn to his left temple, his eyes were closed partially like he was half asleep, he had markings on his neck and his tongue was hanging out as if he was grasping/panting for air,\" she wrote.\"His beautiful face was still heavenly, the same,\" she said. Hamilton\\'s last weekend was all about celebration. After getting the Home Depot job offer, he went out with friends Saturday night and didn’t return home until early Sunday. When he woke up, he went for a walk with Max, the family\\'s Jack Russell Terrier. He showered and put on an expensive outfit he just had to have for his 20th birthday in January. Campbell said she didn’t know what made the clothes so special, but he loved them so she bought them. He was wearing them when he left the house.\"(He) said he was going out – it was daylight out – and said, ‘Mom, bye,’ ” she said.“If I had a known it was going to be my last time,” Campbell said, her voice beginning to choke up. “I would’ve kissed him, I would’ve held him tighter if I had known. I would’ve called on Jesus to protect him …”Wicks said Hamilton and her son had plans to go to an indoor trampoline park that night with about eight other friends, Wicks said.Wicks last saw her son at her house before they left for somewhere after 5 p.m. Sunday. Around 6 p.m., a friend spoke by phone to Hamilton and was told he and Anderson were heading down 79th Street. Wicks said she called her son around 9 p.m. — it rang but he didn’t answer. Around the same time, someone called police to report the Monte Carlo was illegally parked in the alley on Throop. It’s not known if police checked it then. About 2 a.m. Monday, Campbell filed a missing persons report with the Blue Island Police Department. Officials told her the car had been recently spotted by Chicago police and the plates had been checked.The officials indicated he was likely safe, but Campbell said she now regrets not asking where exactly the car was spotted.“They told me Chicago police did run his plates at 12 midnight. I asked what does that mean – he’s not in custody – and they said he could’ve been in a traffic accident, the plates could’ve been run just while he was driving,” Campbell said.“If I could’ve known the location when Blue Island came and told me at 2 a.m. that they had ran my baby’s plates, but no one was in custody, they assured me that it would be OK. If I had known where. If I could’ve gotten to him earlier, if I could’ve saved him …”Campbell works as a licensed practical nurse.She is also frustrated no one went to check inside the illegally parked car when it was first reported.\\xa0 “I know he’s got tinted windows, but why didn’t anyone look inside with a flashlight?” she asked.Campbell and her son had moved out of the Ashburn neighborhood, where so many of Hamilton’s friends still live and not far from where her son was found dead. She wanted to create a safer environment for him. “It was just too many killings, burglaries, robberies – and I didn’t want my baby there, I wanted to save him. I would have done anything to save him. I was his mother and his father. I was his everything,” she said, pausing and correcting herself, \"I am his everything.\"The growing violence also weighed heavily on Hamilton\\'s best friend.Two weeks ago, Wicks asked her three sons over dinner what they thought of moving to California. Anderson, who loved football, fashion and barbecuing, told her he wanted to get out of town after he finished school.“He was like, \\'It’s just too many killings going on here,’ ” Wicks said.kdouglas@chicagotribune.comhschroering@chicagotribune.comTwitter: @ohitsheather'}), (' 25.

That wouldn\\'t make sense to me.\"Deenihan said Jacobs\\' slaying and the quadruple homicide had some gang overtones involving members of the Black P Stones and the Lafa faction of the Gangster Disciples.When the shooting stopped, two young men lay dead inside the South Shore restaurant Thursday afternoon, another was dead outside and a fourth was found dead around the corner, slumped against a tree.Paramedics draped a sheet over the man outside the Nadia Fish and Chicken restaurant at 75th Street...When the shooting stopped, two young men lay dead inside the South Shore restaurant Thursday afternoon, another was dead outside and a fourth was found dead around the corner, slumped against a tree.Paramedics draped a sheet over the man outside the Nadia Fish and Chicken restaurant at 75th Street...The quadruple homicide was among seven killings that happened in South Shore last Thursday.\\xa0The spate of violence came just as Chicago police were touting a drop in homicides and shootings in the first quarter of 2017.A few hours before the restaurant killings, 26-year-old Patrice Calvin, who was four months pregnant, was found shot to death inside an apartment near\\xa075th Street\\xa0and Luella Avenue.About seven hours after the quadruple slayings, a man and woman were in a silver van outside the South Shore Cultural Center on\\xa071st Street\\xa0near South Shore Drive when a black Jeep pulled alongside and someone inside fired shots, police said. The victims, Cornell Patrick, 27, and Dominique Scott, 23, were dead on the scene.Deenihan said his detectives believe those two killings \"may be related\" to the quadruple homicide, but he would not elaborate.

Emmanuel Stokes, 28, was inside the restaurant\\xa0with Edwin Davis, 32.\\xa0Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at the news conference that the quadruple killings are another example of how criminals who use guns illegally have no worries about their actions.\\xa0This is Harris\\'s first arrest as an adult, but he has an \"extensive juvenile history\" who is \"no stranger to CPD nor is he unfamiliar with using an illegal handgun,\" Johnson said.\"Obviously we failed him as a juvenile,\" Deenihan. \"If someone would do a deep analysis into him as a juvenile, it\\'d be no shock that we\\'re here talking...today about this.\"We keep putting a person back in the exact same situation and environment, I mean, I\\'m not sure why we\\'re expecting different results,\" said Deenihan.He also said that Jacobs had been arrested 47 times and had been arrested for two homicides.

Takiya Holmes is his cousin.“You know I, even after the death of my own daughter, I continued on. It hit home close again. I just can’t stop helping these families. Even though my heart was just torn and broken,” Andrew Holmes said. “It’s different in so many ways when it’s your own family. You’ve got the same pain, the same feeling as if it wasn’t your family, then there’s so much anger. You feel that anger coming up.”He spent hours with his relatives in the hospital while Takiya was hooked up to a ventilator that kept her breathing, he said. Naikeeia Williams never left her daughter’s bedside, Holmes said. Tuesday morning, doctors decided it was time to check her breathing.“The doctor did a procedure to see if there was any response,” Holmes said. “The test was still negative. She wasn’t breathing on her own even when we took her off the ventilator. That’s when the decision came down.”Friends and family were able to say their last goodbyes at Takiya’s bedside, Holmes said.“Those that are coming in that are talking by her bedside they’re talking about the things they used to do together, telling stories,” he said. But it wasn’t as easy for him.The family decided to donate Takiya’s organs. Around 4:30 p.m., the forms were almost filled out, Holmes said. Her kidneys were to be the first organs harvested for removal, he said.Patsy Holmes described her only granddaughter as an \"active, jovial child\" with \"eyes and dimples that will set your heart on fire.\"She was a fifth-grade student at Theophilus Schmid School, where her name was typically on the honor roll. She got upset when it wasn’t, her grandmother said.Like any 11-year-old, her interests changed by the day. She enjoyed dancing, singing and, at one point, expressed interest in being a teacher. She also tried her luck in sports, joining a basketball team.\"She lived life, and she loved it,\" Patsy Holmes said.Holmes said she tried to instill homemaking skills for her only grandchild, who called her “big momma.” Every other weekend, when Takiya visited, they set out to make a different confection: cakes or pies or chocolate-covered strawberries.“Last weekend, she made brownies and they were really good,” Holmes said Sunday.She last saw Takiya on Friday when Holmes dropped her off from school. \"She said, \\'Bye, Big Momma, I love you.\\' I told her, \\'See you Monday.\\' \"But Saturday night, she got a call that the girl had been shot. Patsy Holmes said she needed to hear the news three times before it registered.On Tuesday, after Takiya died, Patsy Holmes said the girl\\'s organs were being donated. \"That\\'s the kind of person Takiya was. She would have wanted that.\"Our community has to come together to protect our children,\" she added. \"Our children are innocent getting caught by stray bullets. The other little girl who got shot, my prayers are going out to that family.\"Kanari, the other girl shot over the weekend on the South Side, was struck by gunfire\\xa0about half an hour before Takiya while playing basketball with friends at Henderson Elementary School in the West Englewood neighborhood, where she attended, police said.Kanari\\'s family told reporters outside Stroger Hospital that on at least three occasions, paramedics and hospital staff couldn\\'t detect the girl\\'s heartbeat. She remained on life support Tuesday and so far has not responded to her relatives, her family said.“She’s a child and she was gunned down on the streets of Chicago … over nothing at all,\" Kanari\\'s grandmother, Patricia Donald-Bowers, said Monday. “Right now, she’s my priority. … All I can do is focus on her.”At a community event Monday evening, Henderson Principal Marvis Jackson-Ivy said shootings near the school are common. She said students could not leave school one day last fall to avoid walking past a crime scene. She said the school hires two officers every year so the kids can have recess outside.“We’ve lost 50 students since September due to violence in the neighborhood,” she said. “They move to Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana— they moved out of the state.”Police said no one was in custody in either shooting.Police spokesman Michael Carroll said detectives were canvassing both areas for any private video and reviewing footage from city police cameras. He said the shootings were not related and the girls were both unintended targets.“Shooters were aiming at other individuals when the girls were hit by stray rounds,” Carroll said, adding the both shootings occurred in areas with “high gang conflicts.”'}), (' 27.

(John J. Kim/ Chicago Tribune)Police fatally shot a woman who reportedly was brandishing a knife outside a CVS Pharmacy store in the 3900 block of North Western Avenue on Feb. 10, 2017, in Chicago. (John J. Kim/ Chicago Tribune)Chicago police on Saturday continued to investigate an officer-involved shooting of a 55-year-old woman fatally shot by officers in the North Center community Friday.Officers shot the woman around 6 p.m. in the 3900 block of North Western Avenue near a CVS Pharmacy store where she was reportedly destroying items, prompting a call to authorities.Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said investigators were looking at the possibility that she was trying to force officers to shoot her -- a phenomenon known as “suicide-by-cop.” But police also were looking into whether the woman suffered from any psychiatric problems, noting that officers twice used a Taser on the woman to no effect.“Right now, it’s just too soon to tell,” Guglielmi said.A report in a 2014 FBI Law Bulletin describes suicide by cop as “a situation where individuals deliberately place themselves or others at grave risk in a manner that compels the use of deadly force by police officers.”These incidents are common, according to law enforcement, but difficult to classify, as some perpetrators are killed before their true intentions are known. Across the country this\\xa0past week alone, were reports of at least three attempted suicides by cops, including a California man fatally shot\\xa0after he threw a knife at California Highway Patrol officers in Santa Monica.A woman has died after she was shot by a Chicago police officer in the North Center community Friday night on the North Side.It happened in the 3900 block of North Western Avenue near a CVS Pharmacy store, police and other officials said.Shortly before 6 p.m., officers responded to a call of...A woman has died after she was shot by a Chicago police officer in the North Center community Friday night on the North Side.It happened in the 3900 block of North Western Avenue near a CVS Pharmacy store, police and other officials said.Shortly before 6 p.m., officers responded to a call of...The woman was outside the pharmacy when officers arrived, Guglielmi said. She walked toward the officers, both assigned to the Town Hall patrol district, and they saw that she was armed with \"what appeared to be a knife,\" he said.He said the woman \"made some threatening statements,\" and the officers tried to calm her down. It is possible she may have been intentionally trying to goad the officers into shooting her, officials said.She continued to walk toward the officers, before they deployed a Taser on her twice, Guglielmi said.\"That had no effect,\" he said. \"She continued to advance after that, making threatening statements toward the officers, and the officers discharged their service weapons.\"The Cook County medical examiner\\'s office identified the woman as Michele Robey, of the 5600 block of North Spaulding Avenue in the small Hollywood Park neighborhood on the North Side. Robey\\xa0was pronounced dead at 6:30 p.m. at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center. A Saturday autopsy determined Robey died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen and her death was ruled a homicide, the office said.Darryl Dixon, 55, said he saw the woman lunge at one of the officers.\"She was yelling ... \\'I got a knife! I will cut you! Get back! I will cut you! I\\'m not playing!\\'\" he said.Another witness said that, as he was driving in the area, he had to stop suddenly when he turned onto Western because he encountered a woman standing in a brick crosswalk, flanked by two police officers.He said she was wearing a dark-colored puffy down coat, baggy pants and a stocking cap and was holding a fountain drink. The woman did not appear to be doing anything aggressive and there was no physical contact between her and the male and female officers, the witness said.As the uniformed officers stood near her, the male officer screamed multiple times, \"Drop it!\" or \"Stop it!\" the witness said.The women then turned toward the female officer and he heard, \"Pow, pow!\" The woman dropped her drink and collapsed on the street falling on her right side. \"She didn’t move again,\" he said.Her eyes remained open, but she was motionless as the male officer kicked a dark-colored object toward the curb, he said.The witness said he did not see the officer’s gun when he fired and he noticed a Taser on the ground nearby.Within moments, the area was swarming with dozens of police officers and at least one helicopter.\"This happened so quickly,\" he said. \"I\\'m shaken up.\"Rosemary Regina Sobol contributed reporting.\\xa0\\nThe spelling of Michele Robey\\'s first name has been corrected in this story following a review of public records.\\nThe spelling of Michele Robey\\'s first name has been corrected in this story following a review of public records.'}), (' 21.

Michael Pfleger, an anti-violence activist and Roman Catholic priest. The national news program focused on the 80 percent decline in street stops by police and a decline in arrests, even as the city’s homicide rate escalated.At the news conference, prior to the national broadcast, Johnson dismissed the notion that the skyrocketing violence could be attributed to a lack of effort by police, citing a 10 percent increase in gun-related arrests and 20 percent more gun recoveries in 2016.“I still get on the street quite a bit, I’ll still talk to gang members,” Johnson said. “Almost everyone I talk to will say, ‘I knew it was wrong. But I still chose to do it.’ The mentality that you’d rather CPD to catch you with a gun than your rival to catch you without it, that’s Bizarro World. It shouldn’t be like that. We should have a culture where everyone is accountable.”Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson discusses crime in the city in 2016 and shares the department's strategy for handling crime in 2017 during a news conference Jan. 1, 2017, at Chicago police headquarters in the Bronzeville community. \\xa0Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson discusses crime in the city in 2016 and shares the department's strategy for handling crime in 2017 during a news conference Jan. 1, 2017, at Chicago police headquarters in the Bronzeville community. \\xa0Johnson said he was optimistic that 2017 will be a safer year for Chicago, pointing to several new policing initiatives, including the rollout of data-driven command centers in the violence-plagued Englewood and Harrison districts later this month.CPD has installed 44 new surveillance cameras across the two districts that police plan to use in tandem with gunfire detection technology, which already allows them to discover shootings on average 5 minutes faster than a typical 911 call.With these new innovations, deputy police chiefs in these districts will be able to better understand gun violence and alter policing strategies to better combat it, Johnson said.He also stressed the importance of renewed community engagement, vowing to assign officers to work with community leaders to address quality of life issues.
